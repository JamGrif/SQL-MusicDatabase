 The project uses MAMP to host a local server environment on my machine to then use phpMyAdmin to manage a MySQL database that is stored on my local disk    
 The database is edited through phpMyAdmin and connected and designed in MySQL Workbench  
 Finally, the database is then used in a C# WinForms project to present the data in a Windows application  
 
 The Windows application allows functionaility such as:  
 - Viewing data in a table  
 - Inserting new elements to a table
